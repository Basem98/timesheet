# Timesheet App
This is my first try to create a web app that actually solves a real-world problem.
I work as a Search Engine Evaluator (Internet Assessor) and an Internet Safety Rater
and a boring part of my duties is to write down each task I finish and keep record of all my tasks and my overall timing,
because I am an independant contractor and I get paid based on the work I finish. That's why I thought of this app.
The Timesheet app simply takes an input which is the average estimated time of a finished task and the task type
and then it does the job of storing this task's data into a database and calculating the daily and monthly overall timing.
With an abstract and simple UI, it allows me to access any of these tasks by their specific dates
or to go back to a specific month and get the overall timing of that month,
in case the company I work for wants me to go back to the timesheet and edit something or make sure that it's right.
